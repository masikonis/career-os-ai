- We use Poetry to manage our dependencies. Do not suggest using pip or other dependency managers; always use Poetry.
- Prefer simple and maintainable solutions. This is an MVP focused on solving core problems efficiently.
- When you need to add logging functionality to your code, use src/logger.py (import get_logger and initialize it) instead of Python's standard logger.
- Feel free to be critical of my requests if needed. Don't always do exactly what I ask; suggest better or simpler solutions when available.
