# Career OS Brand Voice Guidelines

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Developers (from junior to senior) looking for new opportunities or career growth.  
- **Secondary**: Tech leads, entrepreneurial devs, and teams interested in AI-driven insights.  
- **Focus**: Global audience, but with a notable presence in U.S.-based tech ecosystems.

## Tone & Personality
- **Friendly yet knowledgeable**  
  Speak like a supportive peer who knows the ropes.  
- **Empowering & encouraging**  
  Position challenges as solvable; provide actionable guidance.  
- **Credible, not arrogant**  
  Let real solutions, facts, and examples show expertise rather than hype.  
- **Light wit where appropriate**  
  A bit of humor or cleverness is fine; never forced or off-topic.

## Style & Language
- **Concise, clear, and outcome-focused**  
  Busy developers appreciate brevity and directness.  
- **Minimal jargon**  
  Use technical terms when they add clarity; explain or simplify if needed.  
- **Plain English**  
  Cater to a global audience; avoid idioms that don't translate well.  
- **Stories with tangible benefits**  
  Emphasize how our platform solves real problems and delivers results.

## Referencing External Entities
- **Respectful & Neutral**  
  Discuss other companies or brands factually, avoiding bias or disparagement.  
- **Positive Framing**  
  When describing collaborations or success stories, highlight mutual benefits and shared values.  
- **Developer-Centric Relevance**  
  Note why these external entities matter to developers—e.g., relevant tech stacks or noteworthy opportunities.

## Do's & Don'ts

### Do
- **Highlight user impact**  
  Show how we save time, match skill sets, or otherwise enhance careers.  
- **Maintain a positive, forward-thinking tone**  
  Focus on actionable possibilities and solutions.  
- **Use clear calls to action**  
  E.g., "Join now," "Discover your next role," "Get AI-driven insights."

### Don't
- **Overuse buzzwords**  
  Avoid terms like "disrupt," "game-changer," or "revolutionary" without substance.  
- **Adopt a patronizing or overly corporate voice**  
  Speak to developers as competent, capable professionals.  
- **Make unrealistic promises**  
  Provide genuine, data-backed value rather than unfounded hype.

## Job Summary Specific Guidelines
When editing job summaries:
- **Focus on responsibilities and skills**: Highlight key responsibilities and required skills/qualifications.
- **Avoid informal phrases**: Do not use phrases like "join our team," "we're looking for," or "come work with us."
- **Maintain a neutral tone**: Use third-person language and avoid direct appeals to the reader.
- **Be concise and professional**: Keep the summary focused and free of unnecessary fluff.
- **Exclude company-specific language**: Avoid mentioning the company name, location type, or job title unless absolutely necessary.
