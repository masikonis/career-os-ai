    "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a comprehensive business research report on Generation Genius based on the user's query. Let me start by breaking down the query into the required sections: company overview, funding history, team details, market position, and then the structured summary. \n\nFirst, for the company overview, I should look into when it was founded, its mission, core business, and products. From the search results, [1] mentions it was founded in 2018, but [2] says 2017. Wait, [3] also says 2018? Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again. [2] states Generation Genius was founded in 2017 by Dr. Jeff Vinokur and Eric Rollman. [3] says Beverly Crest-based platform since 2018. Maybe 2017 is the founding year, and 2018 when they started operations? Or perhaps different sources have conflicting info. Need to clarify this. Also, [8], the SEC filing, says incorporated in 2017 as a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation. So the correct founding year is 2017. The mission is mentioned in [2] as modernizing educational science videos and in [7] as creating engaging content promoting educational values. But [7] refers to Genius Brands International, which might be a different entity. Wait, no\u2014[7] is about Genius Brands International (GNUS), which seems unrelated based on the content. So focus on [2], which states the mission to modernize outdated science videos in schools.\n\nCore products are K-8 science and math videos with lesson plans, quizzes, etc., as per [1], [6], and [12]. They partnered with National Science Teachers Association ([6]). Products include on-demand videos, lesson plans, activities aligned with NGSS and Common Core.\n\nNext, funding history. [3] mentions initial funding from Howard Hughes Medical Institute ($1M grant) and friends/family rounding to $1.6M total. Then a crowdfunding campaign in 2019 raised $1.07M. [8], the SEC report, details Series Seed I ($600K in 2017-2018) and Series Seed II ($1.069M in 2019 via Reg CF). Also mentions total funding around $2.669M up to 2022. However, [3] says total funding was $1.6M after friends and family, but that might be before the crowdfunding. The SEC filing seems more authoritative here.\n\nTeam details: Founders are Dr. Jeff Vinokur (PhD from UCLA) and Eric S. Rollman ([2], [3]). Key executives include Shane Quast (Director of Growth) and Laura Gratto (CRO) per [4]. Company size: [4] mentions 14 employees in 2022 but now says 16; however, [3] from 2022 states over 3 million students using the platform but doesn't specify current team size.\n\nMarket position: Competitors include Geniebook, Bigtime Science, ExploreLearning ([5]). They were acquired by Newsela in 2025 ([2], [10]), which affects their market position post-acquisition. Traction metrics: Used in 30% of U.S. elementary schools ([2]), over 3 million students ([3]), Inc. 500 list #1 in education (2022) and TIME100 (2023) ([2]).\n\nFor financial info: Pricing models from [9], [12], [13]. School plans range from $175/year for individual classrooms to $5K+/year for districts. Home plans were $145 but discontinued per [13] comments.\n\nStructuring the summary: Company stage is likely growth stage, acquired by Newsela in 2025. Funding status includes seed rounds and acquisition. Product type is SaaS for education with subscription revenue model.\n\nNeed to verify if acquisition is completed as per [2] and [10], which are dated Feb 2025 (current date is Feb 2025). Since it's recent, mention the acquisition as part of their current status.\n\nCitations: Each fact needs to reference the source numbers correctly. Differentiate verified facts (SEC filings) vs company claims (traction metrics from their press releases).\n\nPotential conflicts: Some sources may have overlapping or conflicting info (e.g., founding year), so need to cross-check with the most reliable sources like SEC filings.\n</think>\n\n# Comprehensive Business Research Report on Generation Genius  \n\nGeneration Genius has emerged as a significant player in K\u20138 STEM education since its founding, combining engaging video content with standards-aligned lesson materials to modernize classroom learning[1][2].
